1. Use pooled logistic regression to approximate the $J = 2$ subdistribution hazard functions given covariates $W$ and exposure $X$, where $j = 1$ indicates cancer incidence and $j = 2$ indicates natural cause mortality.
$$\begin{aligned}
h_j(t \mid W, X) &= \lim_{\delta \rightarrow 0} \frac{1}{\delta} \Prob{ t < T < t + \delta, J = j \mid (T > T \cup (T < t \cap J \ne j)), W, X }\\
&\approx \Prob{ t < T < t + 1, J = j \mid (T > T \cup (T < t \cap J \ne j)), W, X } \equiv p_j(t \mid W, X)
\end{aligned}$$
For natural cause mortality ($j = 2$), we start follow-up in the minmum of 1941 or three years after hire, including all who were hired after 1938. For cancer incidence $j = 1$, we start follow-up in 1973 (or 1985 if we do not use SEER). There is still censoring form loss to FU and death due to external causes.

2. For each person-year, evaluate $p_j(t \mid W = w, do(X = x))$ where $x$ is the counterfactual exposure level of interest, and $w$ is the observed covariate combination. Set $S_2(t \mid W, do(X = x)) = \prod^t(1 - p_2(t \mid W, do(X = x)))$. See Greenland's paper on model-based standardization.[@Greenland_2004]

3. For each person-year starting in the first year of cancer incidence follow-up, take the product $p_1(t \mid w, do(X = x)) \cdot S_2(t \mid w, do(X = x))$.

4. Take the sum of products $\sum^T_t p_1(t \mid w, do(X = x)) \cdot S_2(t \mid w, do(X = x))$. This is a "weighted" estimate of the cumulative incidence.

5. Estimate cumulative incidence ratios by evaluating the sum in step 4 for different counterfactual levels of exposure $x$.
